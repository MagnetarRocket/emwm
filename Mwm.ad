!  app-defaults RESOURCE SPECIFICATIONS FOR emwm
!		(emwm's in it's little own world, won't read mwm settings, use "emwm" instead)
!

!!
!! NOTE: In Mwm 1.1.1 and newer, the resources 'buttonBindings' and
!!	 'keyBindings' should not be defined in the Mwm app-defaults file.
!!	 The defaults are set internally in Mwm to 'DefaultButtonBindings' and
!!	 'DefaultKeyBindings' respectively.
!!
!!	 Users and system admin need only define the default button and key
!!	 bindings in the appropriate mwm config file (ie. .mwmrc or
!!	 system.mwmrc).
!!
!!	 The 'windowMenu' resource defaults to 'DefaultWindowMenu', and
!!	 in Mwm 1.2 there is a default root menu that is defined as
!!	 'DefaultRootMenu'.
!!

!Mwm*moveThreshold:		3

!!
!! NOTE: In Mwm 1.2, the resources 'resizeBorderWidth' and 'frameBorderWidth'

!!	 in the Mwm app-defaults file.
